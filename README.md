Leveraging the power of [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) for fun and profit! 
This repository hosts my personal archive of little distroboxes and accompanying instructions 

## usage 

You will need to either install your distribution's version of `distrobox` or do it [the rootless way](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox#alternative-methods) 

### instructions
Simply run the script you want using `bash [script].sh` -- or copy-and-paste at will

## contents

* opengldev-env: A super simple basic script getting you up and running with a Fedora 38 container for your OpenGL/glui needs & assorted docs

## issues & contributing

* If something doesn't work or doesn't look right, feel free to file an issue and I'll get to it :smile: 
* Contributions are more than welcome 


## license 

Given that this is a collection of scripts and associated instructions that anyone can figure out by trial and error, CC0 seems sufficient. 
Distrobox is licensed under GPL-3.0

Enjoy!
